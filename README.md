# flower-pattern-visualizer
A [scarpet](https://github.com/gnembon/scarpet) app to make visualizing flower gradients a whole lot easier.

## Installation
1. Download [flower-pattern-visualizer.sc](https://github.com/bandinator27/flower-pattern-visualizer/blob/main/flower-pattern-visualizer.sc)
2. Save it as **flower-pattern-visualizer.sc**
3. Put the script in your world's `scripts` folder. If that doesn't exist create it.
4. You're done! ðŸ¥³

## How to use
1. If Minecraft is already running run **/script load flower-pattern-visualizer**
2. You'll have a new command available in the world where you saved it, surprisingly called **/flower-pattern-visualizer**
3. Run it without parameters
4. You're done! ðŸ¥³
